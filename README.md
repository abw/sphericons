# Sphericons
This project contains the Fusion 360 models and STL files for a
range of 3D printable sphericons.  They will be featured in a
video I'll be posting to my YouTube channel for makers,
[Make It Down To Earth](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGBt41ue4j5QFqwPg0efcfQ).
I'll add the link here when it's out.

Inspiration was drawn from Angus Deveson's [Incredibly Satisfying Sphericons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wb29-ULRBaE)
on [Maker's Muse](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxQbYGpbdrh-b2ND-AfIybg)
and Devin Montes' [My Super Sphericon Collection with Astrolabicon Puzzle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eESLIrxw2x0&t=666s)
video on [Make Anything](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVc6AHfGw9b2zOE_ZGfmsnw) channel.

### "Atom Bomb" Elliptic Star Hexasphericon
Based on a profile created from three ellipses, similar to the simplified "electrons whizzing around a nucleus" diagram.

### "Orange Whip" Elliptic Star Decasphericon
Two identical parts joined with a centre peg and magnets.  Separate moulded base fits the contours of the decasphericon.

### Two Colour Decasphericon
Printed in separate parts so suitable for single colour 3D printers.

### Nested Hexasphericons
One hexasphericon inside another, rotated through 90 degrees.

### Yin Yang Double Revolve
Not a sphericon but created using the same revolve and twist method.  This has two separate revolves around different axes resulting in an interlocking Yin Yang form.

### Strange Loops
Another non-sphericon created using a series of revolutions around different axes.
